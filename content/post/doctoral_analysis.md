This blog uses the data of [PhDs awarded in the US](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data) to build a **Dash** dashboard. According to the description, "These tables present detailed data on the demographic characteristics, educational history, sources of financial support, and postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients. Explore the Survey of Earned Doctorates data further via NCSES's interactive data tool."

The dashboard can be accessed [here](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/dashboard/cassie1102:6)

I first generated the needed plots using *plotly* and saved them via chart-studio, the notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/cassie1102/mini-project/blob/master/doctoral.ipynb).

Then I created a Chart Studio Dashboards following this [post](https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/create-a-dashboard/).

Please enjoy my dashboard.
