Hello, this post is an introduction on how to build a personal website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hugo is one of the most popular framework for building websites. Github Pages is a static web hosting service provided by Github. Here I listed all the steps of building this website.

## Step 1 - Setup
Set up a working directory on your local machine, mine is called 'projects', and within the "projects" folder create another fold to save your website changes. Mine is called 'blog'.  

Log in to your Github page and create a repository to connect to the 'blog' fold on your machine. It saves all changes you make locally with your website.   

##  Step 2 - Install Hugo  
The Hugo website has detailed tutorial for installing Hugo. On Mac machines, you can simply install it using the following command:

```{shell}
brew install hugo
```

You can check your installation using the command 'hugo version'. If the version pops up on your command window you should be good to go.

## Step 3
